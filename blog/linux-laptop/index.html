        <p>I recently purchased a laptop. My requirements were a HiDPI screen for photo editing, 16GB of RAM and a CPU that is suitable for development (not only of the Node.js full stack variety).</p>
<p>I considered an MBP, but used MacBookâ€™s have horrible keyboard or are too old, and newer ones cost alot. With macs out of the picture, I considered Lenovo, Dell, and Asus, and my budget was up to 1300USD. A refurbished or used thinkpad would have answered all the requirements, except for the screen, and they also have old propietary charging connectors which are annoying if youâ€™re used to USB C.</p>
<p>After much consideration I settled on a <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/il/en/laptops/ideapad/s-series/Lenovo-IdeaPad-S540-13IML/p/88IPS501379">Lenovo IdeaPad S540-IML</a>.
Being a consumer Laptop, I was worried about Linux compatibility, but the specs and price were too good to pass up:</p>
<ul>
<li>10th Gen Intel Quad Core i5-10210U CPU @ 1.60GHz, up to 4.2 GHz</li>
<li>16GB DDR4 2666MHz (soldered, non upgradable)</li>
<li>1TB M.2 2280 SSD PCIe NVMe</li>
<li>13.3 Inch QHD (2560 x 1600)</li>
<li>NVIDIA GeForce MX250, with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM (optional, but doesnâ€™t add much to the price)</li>
<li>2 x USB 3.1 Type-C</li>
<li>1 x USB 3.1 Type-A (Gen 1)</li>
<li>~1.4 KG</li>
</ul>
<p>The plan was to dual boot Windows 10, which will be used for casual gaming and photo editing, and linux for development.</p>

<p>In the past I used Ubuntu, Debian, Mint (both the Ubuntu and Debian based editions), Fedora and most recently Arch linux. I also heard about PopOS so I thought to give it a try as well.</p>
<p>I created a PopOS live USB, and the system looked good, but had a freezing issue. Perhaps it would have been solved by installing updates, but I didnâ€™t check. Other than that everything worked which encouraged me.</p>
<p>I later tried linux mint, which failed to detect the Wi-Fi card. It was also slow compared to PopOS, which I think was down the the desktop environment (Cinnamon vs Gnome for PopOS).</p>
<p>The third system I tried, and the one I stuck to was Manjaro gnome edition. I like arch, but wanted something easier as this will be my main system.</p>

<p>The main deliberation here was partitioning. Since I want to dual boot with Windows 10. Most reccommend disabling Secure Boot and fast boot. Before disabling them my system didnâ€™t boot from the live USB.
After disabling them, I shrank the Windows partition to half its size.
I booted into the Manjaro live USB, and started the graphical installer.
There are conflicting articles about whether to use one or two UEFI boot partitions. I opted to leave the Windows boot partition as is and create a different one for Manjaro as it seems that this has less change of conflicts if Windows decides to change something in the boot partition.
This is the final partition layout:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2e3440;color:#d8dee9;"><code><span>|             Type             |   Size   |       Role       |   Mount   |

</span></code></pre>

<p>Run updates, install chromium, Code OSS (VS Code), 
I like a drop down terminal, and <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1509/drop-down-terminal-x/">this</a> one works well.</p>

<p>I encountered two issues, random freezing, which was solved by upgrading the system, and no sound, which was solved as described in the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_IdeaPad_S540_13IML">Arch Wiki page</a> I opened for the laptop.</p>
<h2 id="installing-scala">Installing Scala<a class="zola-anchor" href="#installing-scala" aria-label="Anchor link for: installing-scala">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>Install a JDK (Arch only has OpenJDK) and the sbt package.
I use Visual Studio Code, and the version in the repostiries is the open source one Code OSS.
Install the Metals extension for Code OSS.
Then I had a really weird error when downloading dependencies from sbt. This <a href="https://classicforum.manjaro.org/index.php?topic=236.0">solution</a> worked.</p>
<p>It took a day, but in the end Iâ€™m really happy with the system.</p>
