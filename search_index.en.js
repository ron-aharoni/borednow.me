So I jumped on the opportunity to build one with him.\nParts🔗\nI ordererd the following:\n\nNyquist 60% ortholinear PCB and plates from keeb.io\nCherry Brown switches\nDSA keycaps from pimpmykeyboard.com\nFancy TRRS and USB-C cables\n\nThe assembly process, with the help of my friend, was pretty simple. We installed the space bar stabilizers, soldered the switches and assembled the top and bottom plates.\nDesigning a layout🔗\nDue to the keyboard being a 60% keyboard, and missing some keys, several layers are needed. Here are my layers for the Nyquist:\n\n\nFlashing the firmware🔗\nThe hardest part was surprisingly flashing the firmware, which is why I decided to document it here.\n\nInstall qmk\nBuild your keymap on https://config.qmk.fm/\nDownload the keymap json and save it in the qmk_firmware folder (the qmk installation location).\nGenerate the firmware by running the following command:\n\n$ qmk compile mylayout.json\n\nThis copies the firmware into qmk’s firmware folder.\n5. Reset your keyboard.\n6.

My requirements were a HiDPI screen for photo editing, 16GB of RAM and a CPU that is suitable for development (not only of the Node.js full stack variety).\nI considered an MBP, but used MacBook’s have horrible keyboard or are too old, and newer ones cost alot. With macs out of the picture, I considered Lenovo, Dell, and Asus, and my budget was up to 1300USD. A refurbished or used thinkpad would have answered all the requirements, except for the screen, and they also have old propietary charging connectors which are annoying if you’re used to USB C.\nAfter much consideration I settled on a Lenovo IdeaPad S540-IML.\nBeing a consumer Laptop, I was worried about Linux compatibility, but the specs and price were too good to pass up:\n\n10th Gen Intel Quad Core i5-10210U CPU @ 1.60GHz, up to 4.2 GHz\n16GB DDR4 2666MHz (soldered, non upgradable)\n1TB M.2 2280 SSD PCIe NVMe\n13.3 Inch QHD (2560 x 1600)\nNVIDIA GeForce MX250, with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM (optional, but doesn’t add much to the price)\n2 x USB 3.1 Type-C\n1 x USB 3.1 Type-A (Gen 1)\n~1.4 KG\n\nThe plan was to dual boot Windows 10, which will be used for casual gaming and photo editing, and linux for development.\nChoosing a distro🔗\nIn the past I used Ubuntu, Debian, Mint (both the Ubuntu and Debian based editions), Fedora and most recently Arch linux. I also heard about PopOS so I thought to give it a try as well.\nI created a PopOS live USB, and the system looked good, but had a freezing issue. Perhaps it would have been solved by installing updates, but I didn’t check. Other than that everything worked which encouraged me.\nI later tried linux mint, which failed to detect the Wi-Fi card. It was also slow compared to PopOS, which I think was down the the desktop environment (Cinnamon vs Gnome for PopOS).\nThe third system I tried, and the one I stuck to was Manjaro gnome edition. I like arch, but wanted something easier as this will be my main system.\nInstallation steps🔗\nThe main deliberation here was partitioning. Since I want to dual boot with Windows 10. Most reccommend disabling Secure Boot and fast boot. Before disabling them my system didn’t boot from the live USB.\nAfter disabling them, I shrank the Windows partition to half its size.\nI booted into the Manjaro live USB, and started the graphical installer.\nThere are conflicting articles about whether to use one or two UEFI boot partitions. I opted to leave the Windows boot partition as is and create a different one for Manjaro as it seems that this has less change of conflicts if Windows decides to change something in the boot partition.\nThis is the final partition layout:\n|             Type             |   Size   |       Role       |   Mount   |\n|:----------------------------:|:--------:|:----------------:|:---------:|\n|          EFI system          |  260 MiB |   Windows boot   |           |\n| Microsoft reserved partition |  16 MiB  |     god knows    |           |\n|  Basic Data Partition (NTFS) |  451 GiB |   Windows data   |           |\n|          EFI System          |  512 MiB |    Linux boot    | /boot/efi |\n|           linuxswap          | 7.91 GiB |       Swap       |           |\n|             ext4             |   27.94  |    Manjaro OS    |     /     |\n|             ext4             |   27.94  |  Alternative OS  |           |\n|             ext4             |  436 GiB |       home       |   /home   |\n|             ntfs             | 1000 MiB | Windows recovery |           |\n\nPost install🔗\nRun updates, install chromium, Code OSS (VS Code), \nI like a drop down terminal, and this one works well.\nFixing issues🔗\nI encountered two issues, random freezing, which was solved by upgrading the system, and no sound, which was solved as described in the Arch Wiki page I opened for the laptop.\nInstalling Scala🔗\nInstall a JDK (Arch only has OpenJDK) and the sbt package.\nI use Visual Studio Code, and the version in the repostiries is the open source one Code OSS.\nInstall the Metals extension for Code OSS.\nThen I had a really weird error when downloading dependencies from sbt. This solution worked.\nIt took a day, but in the end I’m really happy with the system.\n","id":"https://borednow.me/blog/linux-laptop/","title":"Linux laptop"},"https://borednow.me/blog/this-blog/":{"body":"A brand new website is born! \nThe year is now 2022, and I’ve finally redone my website! \nThis is my second one, the previous was done with Hexo, but I felt it too complicated and somewhat not maintained.\nDomain🔗\nBought from namecheap.
