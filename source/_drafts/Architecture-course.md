We were recently given time at work, 2 hours each two weeks (40 hours total), to learn software architecture. Since the course is geared at beginner programmers, I decided to create my own course. It will include topics from compilers, distributed systems, databases, and a bit of programming languages.
I will update on each lesson as I do it. So far I thought of the following units:

## Intro
[The Death of Architecture](http://www.julianbrowne.com/article/death-of-architecture)

[Out of the tar pit](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/design/out-of-the-tar-pit.pdf?raw=true)

## Low level
[LLVM](https://llvm.org/pubs/2003-09-30-LifelongOptimizationTR.pdf).

## Distributed systems
[Harvest, yield and Scalable Tolerant Systems](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.24.3690&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

[Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2016/12/Time-Clocks-and-the-Ordering-of-Events-in-a-Distributed-System.pdf)

[Life beyond Distributed Transactions: an Apostate’s Opinion](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~cs223/papers/cidr07p15.pdf)

[Paxos Made Simple](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/paxos-simple.pdf)

[LogPlayer: Fault-tolerant Exactly-once Delivery using gRPC Asynchronous Streaming](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11286.pdf)

## Serverless
[Starling: A Scalable Query Engine on Cloud Function
Services](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11727.pdf)
